The code is provided "as-is", in the original form that it had at the end of the internship. 
Due to difficulties in finding online the exact versions of the needed dependencies, they are committed into the projects, instead of being handled by the build.sbt file.
In case of problems with the publication of such libraries, please contact and I will proceed with their removal.
